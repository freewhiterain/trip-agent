"""Phase 2 end-to-end coverage for the Chengdu local mock RAG workflow.

Covers the full chain declared in
docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-23-trip-agent-phase2-mock-rag-implementation.md (Task 7):

    confirmed form -> Supervisor exactly once -> five category-scoped RAG
    queries -> five Worker Agent results -> evidence-backed mock draft

plus the two required degradation paths: missing category fixtures and
Worker Agent/LLM failure.
